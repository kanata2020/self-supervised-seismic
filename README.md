# Self-Supervised-seismic

## Overview
This repository focuses on Generative Self-Supervised Learning for Seismic Event Classification for identifying earthquake, micro-earthquake, rockfall, and noise events. The project includes pre-trained SSL models in the model folder, data for training and testing in the data folder, and Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating every downstream task's example in the example folder. Generalisation test of pre-trained model is in script folder.

## Model
The model folder contains pre-trained SSL models ready for use. These models can be loaded and employed for any downsteam tasks without the need for extensive training.

## Data
The data folder includes datasets that can be used to assess the performance of the pre-trained models. Feel free to use these datasets to test the dowmstream tasks.

## Example
The example folder provides Jupyter Notebook (ipynb) files that showcase the training step and offer examples of different downstream tasks. 
These notebooks are designed to show users how to use the pre-trained SSL and reproduce all downstream tasks.
